Understanding the Impact of Ozempic on Obese and Hypertensive Patients

📅 Project Details
Objective: Explore the effects of Ozempic on obese and hypertensive patients aged between 40-75, with a focus on addressing endogeneity to estimate the treatment effect accurately.
📚 Data Description
The project utilizes two main datasets:

Medical Claims Data: Contains services rendered to the specified patient group, available in various sample sizes.
Prescription Data: Details prescriptions dispensed to a fraction of the patients in the medical claims dataset.
🛠 Setup and Preprocessing
Environment: Analysis performed using Jupyter Notebook.
Preprocessing Steps:
Handling missing data through imputation and exclusion of non-informative records.
Encoding categorical variables for model compatibility.
Merging Medical and Prescription datasets with a focus on maintaining data integrity.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting distributions and relationships between variables.
Key Findings: Identified potential outliers and patterns that indicate the effect of Ozempic on patient health outcomes.
📈 Causal Analysis
Endogeneity Concerns: Discussed the potential issues that might bias the estimation, such as omitted variables and reverse causality.
Approach: Implemented the Double-Lasso technique to handle endogeneity and ensure robust estimation of treatment effects.
🧪 Model Development
Model Chosen: Double-Lasso for its effectiveness in dealing with high-dimensional data and controlling for endogeneity.
Variable Selection: Rationale provided for each variable included, based on clinical relevance and statistical significance.
🔍 Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluated using R-squared, RMSE, and diagnostic plots.
Interpretation: Detailed discussion on the estimated treatment effects and their implications for healthcare practices.
📝 Additional Insights
Demographic Analysis: Integrated demographic data from census to understand the socio-economic factors influencing treatment outcomes.
Contextual Enrichment: Utilized external sources like FDA trial findings to enhance the analysis context.
🔄 Flexibility in Approach
This project encourages creative and critical thinking. Various methods, functions, and packages were explored to deliver insightful and justified analytical results.

📁 Submission
